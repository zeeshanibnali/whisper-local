# GPU Onboarding

As a *non-technical user* I want **the app to set up GPU acceleration for me** so I get faster transcription without needing to understand CUDA, ROCm, or CT2 wheels.

## Background

GPU acceleration makes transcription dramatically faster and enables larger, more accurate models. The app already detects GPU hardware, runtimes, and CT2 variants on startup (`platform/windows/gpu.py`). But detection only *reports* — it doesn't *act*. Users must manually install runtime libraries, swap CT2 wheels, and edit config. This plan adds an onboarding flow that does it all for them.

### GPU classes

| GPU class | Runtime needed | CT2 wheel | Pip-installable? |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|-----------------|
| NVIDIA | CUDA Toolkit 12 | Standard PyPI (already installed) | Yes |
| AMD RDNA2+ (RX 6000+, RX 7000+, RX 9000+) | ROCm/HIP 7.2 | ROCm wheel from custom repo | Yes |
| AMD RDNA1 (RX 5000) | ROCm/HIP 6.2 | Custom ROCm wheel from custom repo | Yes |

### What needs installing per GPU class

**NVIDIA:** Runtime libraries only. The standard CT2 wheel from PyPI is already the CUDA build.
- `nvidia-cuda-runtime-cu12`, `nvidia-cublas-cu12`, `nvidia-cudnn-cu12`, etc.
- TODO: Research exact packages and sizes

**AMD RDNA2+:** Runtime libraries + replace CT2 wheel.
- ROCm SDK pip packages from `repo.radeon.com`
- CT2 ROCm wheel from custom GitHub repo
- TODO: Research exact packages and sizes

**AMD RDNA1:** Same as RDNA2+ but different ROCm version and different CT2 wheel.
- ROCm 6.2 SDK pip packages
- Custom CT2 wheel from custom GitHub repo
- TODO: Research exact packages and sizes

## Architecture

### Two separate components

```
detect_and_print()          ← already exists, runs on startup, prints status
    |
    v  returns (gpu_class, gpu_name, ct2_works)
    |
onboarding.check_gpu()      ← NEW, reads detection results, decides whether to prompt
    |
    v
prompt_choice()             ← terminal_ui prompt if action needed
    |
    v
pip install ...             ← install packages, configure app, exit
```

### Detection API changes

`detect_and_print()` currently prints and returns nothing. It needs to return a tuple so the onboarding module can consume the results:

```python
def detect_and_print(configured_device) -> tuple[str | None, str | None, bool]:
    # ... existing detection and printing logic ...
    return (gpu_class, gpu_name, ct2_works)
```

Returns `(None, None, False)` when no GPU detected. macOS stub returns the same.

### Config

```yaml
onboarding:
  gpu: pending          # pending | complete | skipped
  gpu_class: null       # nvidia | amd_rdna2+ | amd_rdna1 | integrated_cpu | null
```

- `gpu: pending` — default, run the check
- `gpu: complete` — GPU acceleration configured and working
- `gpu: skipped` — user explicitly said "don't ask again"
- `gpu_class` — records what hardware was found. Used by `update_checker.py` to restore AMD CT2 wheels after upgrade. Extensible to `apple_silicon`, etc. when we add more engines.

When no GPU is detected, set `gpu_class: integrated_cpu` and `gpu: skipped`. Later when we add Metal/iGPU engine support, we can reset `gpu: pending` for `integrated_cpu` users.

### Update integration

For AMD users, `pip install --upgrade whisper-local` (from auto-update) replaces the ROCm CT2 wheel with the standard CUDA build from PyPI. The `update_checker.py` module reads `onboarding.gpu_class` from config and re-installs the correct CT2 wheel after upgrading.

The CT2 wheel URL mapping lives in `onboarding.py` and is imported by `update_checker.py`. Note: `run_update(version)` currently only takes `version` — needs `config_manager` added as a parameter. GPU restore must happen after pip upgrade but before the pyapp restart (`subprocess.Popen`):

```python
# In update_checker.py run_update(), after pip upgrade, before restart
from .onboarding import restore_gpu_packages

restore_gpu_packages(config_manager)
```

```python
# In onboarding.py
def restore_gpu_packages(config_manager):
    gpu_class = config_manager.get_setting('onboarding', 'gpu_class')
    if not gpu_class or not gpu_class.startswith('amd'):
        return
    ct2_url = get_ct2_wheel_url(gpu_class)
    print("   Restoring GPU packages...")
    result = subprocess.run([sys.executable, "-m", "pip", "install", "--force-reinstall", "--no-deps", ct2_url])
    if result.returncode != 0:
        print("   Failed to restore GPU packages. GPU acceleration may need to be re-installed.")
```

## Onboarding Flow

### Decision tree

```
App starts → detect_and_print() → onboarding.check_gpu()

gpu_class, gpu_name, ct2_works = detection result

1. config gpu == "complete" or "skipped"?
   → Skip (no detection cost)

2. gpu_class is None? (no discrete GPU)
   → Set gpu_class: integrated_cpu, gpu: skipped
   → Skip

3. ct2_works and device == "cuda"?
   → Set gpu: complete, gpu_class: <detected>
   → Skip (already working, auto-configure)

4. GPU found + not fully set up
   → Show prompt
```

### The prompt

One prompt. Non-technical. Shows what they have, what's needed, and why.

```

### Installation flow (option 1)

```
1. Print "Installing GPU acceleration..."
2. Print "   Downloading runtime libraries... (this may take a few minutes)"
3. pip install runtime packages (CUDA or ROCm depending on gpu_class)
4. If AMD: pip install --force-reinstall CT2 ROCm wheel
5. Set config: device: cuda, compute_type: float16
6. Set config: onboarding.gpu: complete, onboarding.gpu_class: <class>
7. Print "   GPU acceleration installed. Please restart Whisper Key."
8. sys.exit(0)
```

User relaunches → detection confirms everything works → skips onboarding.

### "Use CPU for now" (option 2)

If config already has `device: cuda` from a previous broken setup, reset to `device: cpu` to prevent crash. Leave `onboarding.gpu` as `pending` so user is prompted again next launch.

### Progress display

Large downloads need feedback. pip itself prints progress bars. We let pip output directly to the terminal (don't capture stdout):

```python
subprocess.run(
    [sys.executable, "-m", "pip", "install", *packages],
    # Don't capture output — let pip show its progress
)
```

## Implementation Plan

1. Refactor detection to return results
- [x] Make `detect_and_print()` return `(gpu_class, gpu_name, ct2_works)` tuple
  - ✅ Returns `(None, None, False)` when no GPU detected
  - ✅ Quiet GPU test when device != cuda (for onboarding auto-detection)
  - ✅ Full status printing preserved when device == cuda
- [x] Update `hardware_detection.py` wrapper to pass through the return value
- [x] macOS stub returns `(None, None, False)`
- [x] Update `main.py` to capture the result

2. Add onboarding config
- [x] Add `onboarding` section to `config.defaults.yaml`
  - ✅ `gpu: pending` and `gpu_class: null` defaults added

3. Create onboarding module
- [x] Create `src/whisper_key/onboarding.py`
- [x] Implement decision tree
  - ✅ Skips if gpu status is complete/skipped
  - ✅ Auto-sets integrated_cpu + skipped when no GPU
  - ✅ Auto-completes when GPU already working (ct2_works + device=cuda)
  - ✅ Prompts user when GPU found but not set up
- [x] Implement prompt using `terminal_ui.prompt_choice`
- [x] Implement pip install flow per GPU class
  - ✅ NVIDIA: installs CUDA runtime packages
  - ✅ AMD: installs ROCm packages + CT2 wheel
  - ✅ Sets device=cuda, compute_type=float16 on success
  - ✅ Exits for restart after install
- [x] Implement config updates (device, compute_type, onboarding status)
- [x] Define `get_ct2_wheel_url(gpu_class)` for use by both onboarding and update_checker

4. Define GPU package lists
- [x] Research and pin exact NVIDIA CUDA pip packages + versions
  - ✅ nvidia-cuda-runtime-cu12, nvidia-cublas-cu12, nvidia-cudnn-cu12
- [x] Research and pin exact AMD ROCm pip packages + versions + URLs
  - ✅ ROCm 7.2: direct URLs from repo.radeon.com/rocm/windows/rocm-rel-7.2/
  - ✅ ROCm 6.2: direct URLs from repo.radeon.com/rocm/windows/rocm-rel-6.2/
- [x] Research and pin CT2 ROCm wheel URLs for RDNA2+ and RDNA1
  - ✅ RDNA2+: PinW/ctranslate2-rocm per Python version (cp311/cp312/cp313)
  - ✅ RDNA1: manual setup only (HIP SDK 6.2 + community rocBLAS, no pip packages available)
  - ⚠️ **ACTION NEEDED:** Upload RDNA2+ CT2 wheel files to PinW/ctranslate2-rocm for cp311, cp312, cp313
- [ ] Verify all wheels exist for Python 3.11, 3.12, 3.13 (RDNA2+ only)
- [x] Document download and installed sizes per GPU class
  - ✅ NVIDIA: ~2 GB, AMD: ~3 GB

5. Wire into main.py
- [x] Call `onboarding.check_gpu()` after `detect_and_print()`, before component setup
- [x] Pass detection tuple and `config_manager`
- [x] Wire `restore_gpu_packages()` into `update_checker.run_update()`
  - ✅ Added `config_manager` param to `run_update()`
  - ✅ Calls `restore_gpu_packages()` after pip upgrade, before restart

6. Test
- [ ] NVIDIA: install flow end-to-end
- [ ] AMD RDNA2+: install flow end-to-end (primary PC, RX 9070 XT)
- [ ] AMD RDNA1: install flow end-to-end (secondary PC, RX 5700 XT)
- [ ] No GPU: auto-skips, sets integrated_cpu
- [ ] Already working: auto-skips, sets complete
- [ ] "Don't use GPU" persists skip
- [ ] "Use CPU for now" prompts again next launch, resets device to cpu if needed
- [ ] After app update: AMD CT2 wheel re-installed automatically
- [ ] macOS: skips entirely (no-op stub)
- [ ] pip install failure: clear error message, user re-prompted next launch
