- As a *user*, I want **VAD pass** so silences aren't transformed into 20 word hallucination
- As a *user*, I want **better default model** so I won't get low quality STT as 1st xp
- As a *user*, I want **auto-send** so I don't need to hit ENTER for chat/LLM use cases
- As a *user*, I want **multiple hotkeys** so I can utilize different recording modes without changing settings
- As a *user*, I want a **Windows executable installer** so I can install without setting up python and depdencies
- As a *user*, I want **Start Menu launch compatibility** so the app works when launched from Windows Start Menu
- As a *user*, I want **cancel recording action** so I can reset if I mess up too much without going through transcription and deleting what was pasted
- As a *tester*, I want **PyPI** so I can easily install the app
- As a *user* I want **auto-stop recording** so I won't record to the limit when I accidentally turn it on or forget it is on
- As a *user*, I want to **hide the console window** so the app runs cleanly in the background
- As a *user*, I want to **select audio source** so I can transcribe from different microphones or system audio
- As a *developer*, I want to **WASAPI loopback supported out of the box** so I can implement features like meeting transcription based on audio outputs
- As a *user*, I want to **load custom local models** so I can use specialized or fine-tuned models
- As a *user*, I want **shortcuts to access log and settings** in the systray menu so I can quickly troubleshoot issues
- As a *mac user*, I want **Fn key as modifier** so I can use the ergonomic bottom-left corner for recording
- As a *user*, I want to choose different **languages for transcription** so that I can get a free/passive accuracy boost
- As a *developer*, I want **WASAPI support without scipy** so that the package is smaller and more efficient
- As a *user*, I want **better icons** so that I can easily identify the app state in the system tray
- As a *user* I want **support for more hotkeys** (F13-F24, Insert) so I can use StreamDeck or AutoHotkey triggers
- As a *user* I want **config table in readme** so I can understand the types of functionality available before downloading
- As a *contributor* I want a **LICENSE** so I know the terms for using and contributing
- As a *user* I want **AMD GPU support** so I can use my AMD GPU for faster transcription via ROCm
- As a *user* I want **distil-whisper models** so I get faster transcription with a smaller download
- As a *GPU user* I want **int8_float16 and int8_float32 compute types** so I can use less VRAM and get faster inference on RTX 20xx+ GPUs with INT8 tensor cores
- As a *user* I want to **see CPU vs GPU mode on startup** so I can confirm the app is using the right processing device
- As a *user* I want **direct text injection** so transcriptions reliably reach the target app without clipboard race conditions ([design](../design/auto-paste-reliability.md))
  - As a *user* I want the **auto-paste empty text bug fixed** so transcriptions reach the target app instead of delivering empty text + stray Enter
  - As a *user* I want a **configurable delivery method** so I can choose between direct typing and clipboard paste depending on my target app

- As a *new user* I want **auto GPU detection** so CUDA/ROCm mode is enabled automatically when a compatible GPU is available
- As a *user* I want **voice command hotkey** so I can choose between transcription/command
- As a *user*, I want [**pyapp**](https://github.com/ofek/pyapp) so I can install without worrying about python/pip/etc
- As a *user*, I want **overlay config** so my settings file only contains my customizations and new defaults are picked up automatically on app updates
- As a *user*, I want **automatic updates** to get new features
- As a *user* I want **voice-triggered hotkeys** so I can send keyboard shortcuts hands-free by speaking a trigger phrase
- As a *user* I want **voice commands** so I can quickly activate tasks
- As a *user* I want **transcription preset commands** so I can instantly deliver pre-written phrases without recording or transcribing
- As a *user* I want **hotkey-activated commands** so I can bind specific voice commands to custom hotkeys and skip the speech step entirely
- As a *user* I want **push-to-talk mode** so I can hold the hotkey to record and release to stop, as a configurable alternative to toggle mode

## Resolved Bugs

- **Crash on model load** - bundled correct MSVCP140.dll instead of PyInstaller's incompatible version
- Auto-pasting does not work in Notepad (Alt unfocuses text field) `[WON'T FIX]`
