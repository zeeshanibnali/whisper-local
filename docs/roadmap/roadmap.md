# Whisper Local - Roadmap
@completed.md

## Next
- As a *user* I want **"learn from my fix"** so that when I correct a dictation in place, one hotkey diffs my edit against what was typed and offers to save it as a correction or dictionary word (Wispr Flow's dictionary auto-learn, done offline)
- As a *user* I want **restricted language auto-detect** (`whisper.languages: [en, hi]`) so switching between the languages I speak never lands on one I don't
- As a *developer* I want **spoken casing commands** ("camel case foo bar" → `fooBar`, "snake case …") per app rule, for dictating identifiers
- As a *user* I want **Command Mode without a selection**: "search Perplexity for …" opens a search, "write …" drafts via local Ollama
- As a *user* I want the **level overlay on macOS**, running in its own process so Tk gets its main thread

## Bugs
- **CUDA version forward-compatibility** - onboarding GPU detection doesn't recognize newer CUDA versions (e.g. CUDA 13.x), and CTranslate2 requires `cublas64_12.dll` which isn't present when only CUDA 13+ is installed. Workaround: manually copy CUDA 12 cuBLAS/cuDNN libs into CUDA 13 bin directory. Need to detect newer CUDA versions and guide users to install the required CUDA 12 compatibility libs
- ~~**Silent close when already running**~~ — FIXED in 0.16.0. A windowless launch has no console, so the "already running" message went nowhere; it now shows a dialog (`instance_manager._notify_no_console`). Note the normal path is *takeover*, not refusal — this message only appears when the existing instance is unresponsive.
- **No download progress shown** - HuggingFace model download doesn't display any state or progress to the user. *Partially addressed in 0.16.0*: the first-run message now names the model and its approximate size, so the wait is expected. A real percentage bar still needs a `tqdm`/`hf_hub` callback hookup.
- **Ctrl+C doesn't work after HuggingFace download** - shutdown signal not caught
- **(macOS) System freezes on transcription** - needs verification
- **(macOS) Stop hotkey requires double-press** - remapping stop hotkey to Ctrl requires pressing it twice to stop recording. Default Fn key also conflicts with macOS language keyboard toggle
- **GPU model switch crash** - upstream CT2 bug, `thread_local` GPU handles corrupt HIP/CUDA on Worker thread teardown ([faster-whisper #71](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper/issues/71)). Future option: auto-restart app on model switch in GPU mode

## Backlog

### Voice Commands
- As a *user* I want **command aliases** so I can define multiple trigger phrases for the same command (e.g., "open browser", "launch chrome", and "start browser" all execute the same action)
- As a *user* I want **semantic command matching** so commands are matched intelligently instead of requiring exact phrases (e.g., "open up chrome" still matches "open browser")
- As a *user* I want **parameterized commands** so I can define command templates with variables that are extracted from speech (e.g., "open {filename}" or "search for {query}")
- As a *user* I want **voice commands API** so other apps can do things from whisper key commands
- As a *user* I want **verbal stop recording** command so I don't need to hit the hotkey

### Terminal UI
- As a *user* I want **on-screen hotkey hints** so I can see available controls at a glance like a video game HUD
- As a *user*, I want a **terminal UI** so I can control the app without leaving the command line
- As a *user*, I want a **terminal status bar** so I can see app state, model, and recording status at a glance
- As a *user*, I want **terminal colors and styling** so the CLI feels modern like coding tools (Claude Code, lazygit)
- As a *user*, I want **terminal settings control** so I can change settings interactively without editing YAML
  - As a *user* I want **language selection in CLI** so I can switch transcription language without editing YAML
- As a *user*, I want **wrapped model downloading** so I see a clean progress display and get helpful error messages instead of raw HuggingFace output (symlink errors, cluttered progress bars)

### CLI
- As a *user* I want a **short command alias (`wk`)** in `[project.scripts]` so I can launch the app by typing `wk` instead of `whisper-key`
- As a *user* I want a **CLI interface** so other tools and agents can invoke transcription programmatically
- As a *user* I want to **wrap CLI tools** (e.g., `whisper-key claude`) so I can voice-input directly into any command-line application without switching windows
  - As a *user* I want **additional instances with custom hotkeys** so that I can be keyboard-only when dictating to multiple agents
  - As a *user* I want **hotkey instance management** so that multiple instances will be allowed and work together
- As a *user* I want **agent skill packages** so CLI agents (Claude Code, Codex, OpenClaw, etc.) can install a whisper-key skill from a marketplace and use the CLI
- As a *user* I want **voice command CLI management** so I can list, add, run, and delete voice commands from the command line
  - `whisper-key commands list` — list all configured voice commands
  - `whisper-key commands add` — add a new voice command
  - `whisper-key commands run <command>` — execute a voice command directly
  - `whisper-key commands delete <command>` — remove a voice command

### Onboarding
- As a *new user* I want **first-run onboarding** so I can configure model, audio device, and auto-paste without editing YAML
  - As a *new user* I want **model selection** so I can choose a Whisper model that balances speed vs accuracy without editing YAML
  - As a *new user* I want **CPU detection at startup** so the system check section shows hardware info even when no GPU is present
  - As a *new user* I want **settings overview** so I can see default settings and change them if I want
    - As a *new user* I want **audio device selection** so I can pick my preferred microphone from a list of detected devices
    - As a *new user* I want **language selection** so I can set my transcription language without editing YAML
    - As a *new user* I want **system tray preference** so I can decide whether to show the tray icon or run in background
    - As a *new user* I want **auto-set key simulation delay based on machine specs** so slower computers don't miss keystrokes during auto-paste
  - As a *new user* I want **auto-paste preference** so I can choose between direct paste or clipboard-only mode

### Transcription History
- As a *user* I want a **transcriptions log** so I can review my past transcriptions and look at accidental cancels or overwrites

### GPU Onboarding
- As a *user* I want **guided GPU setup** so drivers and dependencies are auto-detected, downloaded, and installed through an in-app UI instead of manual steps

### Packaging & Updates
- As a *user*, I want **config version tracking with auto-reset on breaking changes** so my settings don't cause errors after major updates

### macOS
- As a *mac user*, I want **pyapp build for macOS** so Mac users get the same single-binary packaging experience as Windows
  - As a *mac user*, I want **`restart_or_exit` to work on macOS** so auto-update and GPU onboarding restart correctly (`CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE` is Windows-only)
- As a *mac user*, I want **better default hotkey** so fn doesn't conflict with emoji picker
- As a *mac user*, I want **CGEventTap hotkeys** so I can use ESC or Cmd+. to cancel recording
- As a *mac user*, I want **monochrome menu bar icons** so the app conforms to Apple's template icon guidelines

### Hotkeys
- As a *user* I want **hotkey sequence ordering** so more hotkey combos can coexist without conflicting (e.g., Ctrl+Alt+Space vs Alt+Ctrl+Space become distinct sequences)
- As a *developer* I want a **typed `HotkeyBinding` contract** between `hotkey_listener.py` and the platform backends so library-specific fields stop leaking across the boundary — today `hotkey_listener` appends a raw `False` 4th element that silently sets `global-hotkeys`' `actuate_on_partial_release=False` on Windows while macOS ignores it entirely, causing undocumented cross-platform drift and making push-to-talk on multi-key combos behave inconsistently (surfaced by [#51](https://github.com/PinW/whisper-key-local/pull/51))

### Personalization
- As a *user*, I want **custom hotwords** so I can bias the transcription model toward rare words and names that I say often
- As a *user*, I want **post-transcription replacements** so consistent misrecognitions are automatically corrected after transcription (e.g., "see translate two" → "CTranslate2")

### Desktop App
- As a *user*, I want a **desktop GUI** so that I can change settings without editing files

### Real-Time Transcription
- As a *user* I want **real-time transcription** so I can preview text as I speak
- As a *user* I want **meeting mode** so I can transcribe an entire meeting in real-time

### Cross-Platform
- As a *Linux user* I want **Linux desktop support** so I can use Whisper Key on my Linux machine — add `platform/linux/` with evdev-based global hotkeys and key simulation, XDG paths, and fcntl instance locking ([research](../research/2026-02-16-linux-support-research.md))
  - As a *Linux user* I want **global hotkeys via evdev** so hotkey detection works on both X11 and Wayland
  - As a *Linux user* I want **key simulation via evdev UInput** so auto-paste works on both X11 and Wayland
  - As a *Linux user* I want **input group permission guidance** so I get clear setup instructions when evdev access is missing
  - As a *Linux user* I want **Linux GPU transcription** so I can use CUDA or ROCm (which works better on Linux than Windows)
- As a *WSL user* I want **WSL support via a Windows hotkey shim** so I can run the app natively in WSL while capturing global hotkeys on the Windows side — small Python shim using ctypes `RegisterHotKey`, communicating over localhost TCP ([research](../research/2026-02-16-wsl-hotkey-shim-research.md))
- As a phone *user*, I want this app on **mobile**

### Transcription Quality
- As a *user*, I want **parakeet models** so I can get transcriptions faster wit more accuracy
- As a *user*, I want **automatic punctuation and text formatting** so the output is human-friendly (not just LLM)
- As a *user*, I want to see my **transcription history** so I can search through it

### Recording
- As a *user* I want **hotkey-per-audio-source bindings** so I can quickly switch between microphone input and speaker/system audio capture
- As a *user*, I want **real-time transcription** so that I can get immediate feedback

### Remote Transcription

  - As a *user* I want **xAI Grok API** so I can use Grok's transcription service

### Developer Use Cases
- As a *developer* I want **project file context** so I can reference files in voice and tag them in chats hands free

### Agent & API Integration
- As a *user* I want **server mode** so I can run transcription on one machine and send audio/receive text from other devices on my LAN (centralized processing for multiple users)
- As a *user* I want **headless/API input mode** so I can receive audio from external sources instead of local microphone
- As a *user* I want **headless/API output mode** so transcriptions can be sent to external services instead of clipboard
- As a *user* I want to **send transcriptions to CLI agents** (Claude Code, Codex, etc.) so I can voice-control coding assistants
